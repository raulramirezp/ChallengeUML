## Challenge UML
For the one who do not have access to confluence yet, I post the challenge:

This challenge splits in 3 exercises as follows:
* Given the following class diagram, implement the domain-model in a new java project.
* Customer and Product are beans, please implement getters and setters as needed.
* Give a concrete implementation to Order.setTotal() method (Hint: you can use a main() method to test it).
* You do not need to provide concrete implementation to other methods, just a dummy one is right enough (everything must compile).

## In a separate package, implement the following class diagram.
* It is not necessary to give concrete implementation of methods, just dummy ones are enough (everything must compile).
* What is this design pattern useful for?
* Create a class diagram given the following case of study:

### The goal is to design a school course domain model. So a Course has no more than 30 Students, where one of the Students is the headman of the Course. The whole course learns the same subjects except for foreign language subject (some of the students learn English and other French). A Teacher can teach from one to many subjects, but he just has one Course assigned. The Student can be evaluated by subject, so he will get a partial grade every 4 months, and a final grade at the end of the school year.
Deliverables
*	A java (.Net) project with the implementation of the 1st and 2nd points. You can host the code in github.
*	A pdf file with the class diagram of the 3th point. It can go in the same guthub repo as above.
